================

# Introduction

This starter project demonstrates one working setup for a new Node.js program to be written in TypeScript. The relationships between NPM package config, TypeScript config, and Lint can be difficult to get right.

# Code Style Rules

The code style rules (defined and managed by ESLINT which has replaced TSLINT) have been modified slightly for a few preferences. You can change these preferences inside the .eslintrc.json file.

- Do not require end of line semicolons
- Prefer single quotemarks
